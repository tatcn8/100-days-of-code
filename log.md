# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 17, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on sorting through seed data using SQL commands in the CLI

**Thoughts:**: Really enjoyable; learned quite a bit in regards to database query. This is my first SQL experience, so far everything else "backend" has been through MongoDB.

### Day 2: February 18, 2022 
**Today's Progress**: Worked on python basically all day; specifically working on functions in Javascript first, then re-writing them in python. Did some code wars games and then finished the lab linked below.

**Thoughts:**: Python was the first language I learned when deciding to become a developer; and it was really fun revisiting if after 9+ weeks of writing nothing but javascript. Have a good weekend everybody!
