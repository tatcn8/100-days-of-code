# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Worked on sorting through seed data using SQL commands in the CLI

**Thoughts:**: Really enjoyable; learned quite a bit in regards to database query. This is my first SQL experience, so far everything else "backend" has been through MongoDB.
