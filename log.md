# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 17, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on sorting through seed data using SQL commands in the CLI

**Thoughts:**: Really enjoyable; learned quite a bit in regards to database query. This is my first SQL experience, so far everything else "backend" has been through MongoDB.

### Day 2: February 18, 2022 
**Today's Progress**: Worked on python basically all day; specifically working on functions in Javascript first, then re-writing them in python. Did some code wars games and then finished the lab linked below.

**Thoughts:**: Python was the first language I learned when deciding to become a developer; and it was really fun revisiting if after 9+ weeks of writing nothing but javascript. Have a good weekend everybody!

### Day 3: February 19, 2022 
**Today's Progress**: Practiced writing functions in both Javascript and Python. Kept it to mostly basic functions (it is Saturday after all) and all the work was found on Codewars. There is an examply snippet (in both JS and Python) below.

**Thoughts:**: Continuing to enjoy playing with Python. Amazed at how quickly the muscle memory returns after taking a few months off from it. 

**Link to work:** 
Python:
def update_light(current):
    if (current =="green"): return ("yellow")
    if (current =="yellow"): return ("red")
    if (current =="red"): return ("green")

JS:
function updateLight(current) {
  if (current === 'green') return 'yellow';
  if (current === 'yellow') return 'red';
  if (current === 'red') return 'green';
  

}

### Day 4: February 20, 2022 
**Today's Progress**: Built out the front end of a budgeting app. Going to eventually build out the backend using MongoDB to be able to track my expenses over time.

**Thoughts:**: React has been a very familiar front end platform. Really this app was a matter of installing the right dependencies (reactstrap, node) and then writing some basic Javascript for the form functionality. I will post a link when it's finished.

**Link to work:** I will post a Git link when I am finished.

### Day 5: February 21, 2022 
**Today's Progress**: More Python today, worked on a bootcamp assignment for a guessing game involving the state capitals.

**Thoughts:**: Happy President's Day! The hardest part of this coding challenge so far has been targeting list elements from a python dictionary; but once I figured it out it wasn't too bad. Need to work on a for loop so that the game can be played continuously without having to click "play" each time.

**Link to work:** Will post Git Repo when finished :)

### Day 6: February 22, 2022 
**Today's Progress**: Finished the python state capital guessing game. There is one small bug due to the way I am running the for loop, but ran out of time to figure it all the way out. Going to be working on Python all day today.

**Thoughts:**: Had a lot of fun with this one; ran into a lot of blockers and slowly overcame them. Found indentation matters in Python quite a bit. Like I said, one small bug remains, but for the most part the game is playable.

### Day 7: February 23, 2022 
**Today's Progress**: Worked on Django installs as well as some more python. Worked specifically on the .super() command to pass functions to subclasses.

**Thoughts:**: Still enjoying python but deep down missing javascript. I also started a side project using React/JS and am just now realizing that I probably started that project due to some frustration with python.

**Link to work:** Not much to show today, maybe I'll link my side project tomorrow.
